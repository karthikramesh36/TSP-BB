# ConcurrentParallelProgramming
This repository contains the parallel solutions to the traveling Salesman Problem using the Best First Search Algorithm or also referred as the Branch and Bound method.
Sequential solution to the Tsp problem is implemented .
further it is modified to a parallel solution by the use of threads,
and further it is improved by implementing the algorithm by running it in a cluster using OpenMP framework.
